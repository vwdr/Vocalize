# Vocalize

**Vocalize** is a command-line tool developed in Go, harnessing the power of OpenAI's Text-to-Speech (TTS) model to convert written text into high-quality spoken audio. Designed for developers and power users, Vocalize provides an interactive and efficient way to generate and play back voiceovers in MP3 format. This README provides an in-depth look at the technologies used, the development process, and detailed instructions for installation and usage.


## Technologies and Rationale

### Go (Golang)
Go was selected for its strong performance characteristics and efficient handling of concurrent operations. Its built-in support for goroutines and channels is particularly suited for the real-time audio playback required by Vocalize. Go's static typing and compiled nature also ensure that the tool runs with minimal overhead and high reliability.

### OpenAI Text-to-Speech Model
The TTS model provided by OpenAI is renowned for its state-of-the-art speech synthesis capabilities. It generates natural-sounding and clear voiceovers, which is crucial for high-quality audio output. By integrating this model, Vocalize ensures that the generated speech is both intelligible and engaging.

### Key Go Libraries

- **`github.com/joho/godotenv`**: This library simplifies the management of environment variables, particularly useful for securely handling API keys. It allows Vocalize to load the OpenAI API key from a `.env` file, maintaining separation between code and sensitive information.
- **`github.com/rs/zerolog`**: Chosen for its high-performance logging capabilities, zerolog provides detailed logging with minimal impact on application performance. This is essential for debugging and monitoring the tool's operation in real-time.
- **`github.com/sashabaranov/go-openai`**: This Go client for the OpenAI API facilitates seamless interaction with OpenAI's services. It abstracts the complexity of API requests and responses, enabling straightforward integration with the TTS model.
- **`github.com/ebitengine/oto/v3`**: Oto is used for audio playback, enabling Vocalize to play back generated voiceovers in real-time. Its efficient handling of audio streams ensures smooth and immediate playback.
- **`github.com/hajimehoshi/go-mp3`**: This library handles MP3 decoding, crucial for processing and playing back MP3 audio files. It ensures compatibility with the audio format used for generating voiceovers.

## Development Process

1. **Project Setup**:
   The initial setup involved configuring the Go environment and setting up the project structure. The decision to use Go was based on its strong performance characteristics and efficient handling of concurrent tasks.

2. **Integration of OpenAI TTS**:
   The integration with OpenAI's TTS model was accomplished by using the `go-openai` client library. This involved setting up API endpoints and handling authentication using environment variables.

3. **Audio Playback Implementation**:
   For real-time audio playback, the `oto` library was incorporated. This required setting up audio streams and ensuring that the playback was synchronized with the audio generation process.

4. **MP3 Decoding**:
   The `go-mp3` library was used to decode MP3 files generated by the TTS model. This step involved integrating the library to handle MP3 format decoding and ensuring compatibility with the audio playback system.

5. **Logging and Debugging**:
   Implementing `zerolog` provided a robust logging mechanism to monitor and debug the application. This included setting up log levels and integrating logging statements throughout the codebase.

6. **Final Testing and Optimization**:
   Extensive testing was performed to ensure the tool's functionality and performance. Optimization efforts focused on minimizing latency and ensuring smooth real-time audio playback.

## Installation

To set up Vocalize, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - **Go**: Ensure Go is installed. [Installation Instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)
   - **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain your API key from OpenAI and configure it in the `.env` file.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vocalize.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd vocalize
   ```

4. **Build the Executable**:
   ```bash
   go build -o vocalize .
   ```

5. **Set the OpenAI API Key**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API key:
   ```bash
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key" >> .env
   ```

6. **Run the Tool**:
   ```bash
   ./vocalize
   ```

## Key Features

- **Advanced Speech Synthesis**: Leverages OpenAI's TTS model for natural and clear voice generation.
- **Interactive CLI**: Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for real-time text-to-speech conversion.
- **Real-Time Playback**: Instantly plays back generated voiceovers using efficient audio handling.
- **Audio Management**: Saves generated audio files in the `voiceover_intros` directory for future reference.

## Usage

Once Vocalize is running, you can input text directly into the command-line interface. The tool will process the text, generate an MP3 audio file, and play it back in real-time.

Example Command:
```bash
$ Enter a text to speak it: Hello, this is Vocalize!
```

The audio output will be saved in the `voiceover_intros` directory and played immediately.
